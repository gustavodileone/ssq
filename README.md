# Fetch SSQ

Simple program that fetches [SSQ](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries) (Server Query Protocol) information and displays on the terminal.

My goal with this was really just practice network programming in linux with C.

Inspired by: [gmod servers](https://gmod-servers.com) and [libssq](https://github.com/BinaryAlien/libssq)

## Build
```
git clone https://github.com/gustavodileone/ssq
cd ssq
make
```

## Usage
`./ssq <hostname> [port]`
